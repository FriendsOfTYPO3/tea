# This workflow does not use the Composer actions for calling the tools.
# Use this workflow if you do not intend to call the code quality checks locally,
# but only in the CI builds.
#
# Note that, to keep things fast, pull requests and pushes do not trigger this workflow.
# If you are going to use this workflow, please copy the corresponding trigger settings from the `ci.yml` workflow.
