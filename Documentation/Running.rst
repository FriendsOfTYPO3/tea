Composer scripts
================

For most development-related tasks, this extension provides Composer scripts.
If you are working locally, you can run them using :bash:`composer <scriptname>`.

The code-quality-related Composer scripts make use of the PHIVE-installed tools.

You can run :bash:`composer` or :bash:`./Build/Scripts/runTests.sh composer` to
display a list of all available Composer commands and scripts. For all custom
Composer scripts there are descriptions in the `script-description` section of
the `composer.json`.
