Attributes
==========

TYPO3 also extends the availability of registering services via attributes.
We will prefer the attributes over Services files.
But we won't use both at once and still need Services files as long as PHP 7.4 is supported.
Attributes will be used in favor of Services files once we drop unsupported PHP versions.
