Documentation rendering
=======================

In order to render the documentation, this extension provides a Composer script
that you can run locally via

.. index:: Commands; composer docs:generate
.. code-block:: bash

   composer docs:generate

You do not need to start or build the containers for this as this happens
automatically.
