# Tea example

This TYPO3 extension is an example for writing unit tests for extbase
extensions for TYPO3 CMS using PHPUnit.

The functional tests for the Repositories provide an example of creating
records using the PHPUnit extension testing framework.

The functional test for the Utility/FileUtility class provides examples
for working with [vfsStream](https://github.com/mikey179/vfsStream/).
