This TYPO3 extension is an example for writing unit tests for extbase
extensions for TYPO3 CMS using PHPUnit.

The functional tests for the Repositories provide an example of creating
records both using the PHPUnit extension testing framework and DBUnit.

The functional test for the Utility/FileUtility class provides examples
for working with [vfsStream](https://github.com/mikey179/vfsStream/).

For information on the different ways to execute the tests, please have a look
at the [handout to my workshops on test-driven development (TDD)](https://github.com/oliverklee/tdd-reader).
